        <h2>Background of the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Global Communities' Septic Tank Calculator was developed to address a critical gap in sustainable wastewater management. Poorly designed septic systems pose significant health and environmental risks, especially in resource-limited settings. This tool provides a robust framework for designing septic tanks and leach fields based on precise engineering calculations.

        <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide an intuitive interface for septic tank design calculations.</li>
            <li>Incorporate real-world factors such as soil type, groundwater levels, and effluent reuse.</li>
            <li>Promote environmental sustainability and public health through proper wastewater management.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>How the Tool Works</h2>
        <p>
            The tool calculates septic tank dimensions and leach field areas using **engineering formulas** and **standard constants** derived from environmental and wastewater management guidelines. Here's a breakdown of the calculations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Volume of Liquid:</b> This is based on the daily water usage per household member, flush count, and cistern size. The formula is:
                <code>Volume of Liquid = Household Size × Flush Count × Cistern Size</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Volume of Sludge:</b> The tool assumes a sludge accumulation rate per person and calculates the total sludge volume.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Total Volume:</b> The total tank volume combines the liquid and sludge volumes, multiplied by a retention time multiplier:
                <code>Total Volume = (Volume of Liquid + Volume of Sludge) × Retention Time</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Leach Field Area:</b> The leach field area is determined by soil percolation rate and total effluent volume. The formula includes a multiplier for effluent reuse and seasonal flooding risks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Constants like <b>sludge accumulation rate</b>, <b>flush count</b>, <b>cistern size</b>, and <b>percolation rates</b> are pre-defined based on standard environmental guidelines and can be adjusted for local contexts.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The backend of the tool is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Inputs from the user are validated and passed to a set of functions in the `calculations.py` file. These functions use predefined constants from `constants.py` to compute the septic tank dimensions, H₂S emissions, and leach field area.
        </p>
        <p>
            The formulas and constants used in the calculations are grounded in standard engineering principles, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.</li>
            <li>WHO standards for wastewater management.</li>
            <li>Site-specific adjustments for effluent reuse and flooding risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The results are rendered dynamically on the Results page, and the tool uses a responsive design for usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
